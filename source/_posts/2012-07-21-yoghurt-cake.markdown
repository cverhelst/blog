## Yoghurt Cake Recipe (Easy)

This cake recipe uses a cup of yoghurt after which you will use this cup for most of the other measurements.

Preheat the oven to 170&deg;.

In a large bowl, mix the following ingredients together:

* 3 eggs
* 1 cup of yoghurt (Vanilla, Natural, Lemon,...)

From now on, use this yoghurt cup for the other measurements.

* 3 cups of flour
* 2 cups of sugar (white)
* 1 cup of olive oil 
    * preferably extra virgin olive oil
    * you can mix it with sunflower oil to reduce the olive flavor
* 1 theespoon of baking powder
    * Use more if you have a tall cake pan
    * Don't wait too long before putting the mix in the oven after adding the baking powder
    
If you want a different kind of cake, you can add either or all of the following:

* Cholocate chips
* Chocolate powder, for a true chocolate cake
* Pistachio or Almond nuts on top of the cake

Put the cake in the oven for about 45 minutes and check if the cake is done by inserting a clean knife in the middle. The cake is done if the knife comes out clean.
